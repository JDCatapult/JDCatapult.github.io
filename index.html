  <div class="post-content">
    <p>  I am a Computer Science and Mathematics major with interest in data analytics, big data,
         image processing/analysis (of remote sensing, satellite images, medical images, etc),
      high performance computing (accelerators, MPI, OpenMP, Python), 
      mathematical modeling, and numerical optimization. </p>
      
    <p>I hold a Ph.D. from the Arizona State University in applied mathematics. 
      My thesis focused on 'High Order Methods for Edge Detection and Applications'. I subsequently taught  at Michigan State
      University and University of California, San Diego while pursuring research in  molecular surface reconstruction as postdoctorate and visiting researcher
      repectively.</p>

    <p>My current appointment is at Virginia  Tech, Blacksburg. My research is in the area of land usage and trend detection
      from satellite images and is a collaboration between Forest Resources and Enviormental Conservation and the Department of Computer Science both at Virginia Tech.</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">LULC-Net: Generalized convolution neural network classfier
for detecting land use changes from satellite data</h2>
    <p>Preliminary investigation of a novel application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), viz.,
	locating regions that have undergone land use and land cover changes.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Developed an algorithm, that strategically combines known algorithms and labels
data to produce high quality labels describing land use and land change.</li>
      <li>The CNN currently consists of 3 convolutional and 3 fully connected layers.</li>
      <li>All training and validation was done on NVIDIA p100 GPU which features 3584 1GHz cuda cores  with 12GB of memory. </li>
      <li>The work has broader significance on detecting changes from image stream from motion camera and webcam.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="post-title">Detection of trends and changes in land use using satellite images</h2>
    <p>Designed and developed an ensemble based approach for change detection
      from spatio-temporal stack of satellite images. The approach 
      collates answers from principally different unsupervised and supervised techniques:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> dynamic programming based method</li>
      <li> harmonic regression based learning method</li>
      <li> random forest based classification tree method and</li>
      <li> convolution neural network based method (under development)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="post-title">Detecting users with dependency traits in Twitter</h2>
    <p>  Developed technique to identify users exhibiting dependence (anomously high activity) to a particular 
      lifestyle such as cosmetics, shopping, etc.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li> Developed focussed crawler that, starting with a set of seed users, grows the potential pool 
        of candidate users through biased exploration of the follower-followee graph.</li>
    <li> Analyzed approx. 10 million users, 10 billion tweets, 1 billion edges, and over 20 facets of the users. </li>
    <li> Analytics was written in python while data managment was done using database. This allowed for concurrent processing of various phases of the analytics pipeline </li>

    <h2 class="post-title">Rendering images from MRI sensors  using inversion of circular radon transforms</h2>
    <p>The geometry and the mechanism for capturing signals inside a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner is complex and challenging -- the sensors are placed along circular arc where they  capture the signal in frequency domain. This  project proposed derivations and algorithms to reconstruct the signal in eucildean-time domain. The project</p>
    <ul>
      <li> represented non-planar MRI scans as recursive integrals </li>
      <li> developed methods that provide approximate answer for the
	integrals efficiently, as exact numerical solution turned out to
	be computationally demanding </li>
      <li> identified generic  programming (C++ templates) as natural constructs to 
	express recursive integrals and their computations</li>
      <li> developed strategy to parallelize the computation using linux threads </li>re

    <h2 class="post-title">Image compression using generalized low rank approximation</h2>
    <p>
      Implemented generalized low rank approximation (GLRA) for matrices  and applied it for image compression.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>obtained 30% data compression ratios, on an average </li>
      <li>GLRA has better time complexity (several orders of magnitude faster) than SVD. </li>
      <li>Reconstruction and classification done using GLRA-compressed images was better than
	that done using SVD compressed data.</li>
      <li>Codes were implemented in Python.</li>
    </ul>
